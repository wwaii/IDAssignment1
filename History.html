      <p class= "passage">Hogwarts was founded by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: 
        Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.
        They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students. However, 
        shortly after founding the school, Slytherin had a falling out with the other founders about blood purity,
        and wanted to admit only pure-blood students. He felt pure-blooded students deserved to learn magic, 
        and those of other ancestry such as Muggle-borns and Half-bloods, were unworthy. 
        The other three founders all disagreed, especially Gryffindor. And, Slytherin then left the school.</p>

      <p class= "passage">About three hundred years after the school was founded, the Triwizard Tournament was established
        as an interscholastic competition between three of the most prestigious magical schools in Europe: 
        Hogwarts, Beauxbatons (France), and Durmstrang (An undetermined Northern European country). 
        This tournament was considered the best way for wizards and witches of different nationalities to meet and socialise.
        The tournament continued for six centuries, until the death toll became too high. 
        The tournament was discontinued until 1994.</p>

      <p class= "passage">The Battle of Hogwarts took place as one of its most infamous alumni, Tom Riddle, 
        better known by then as Lord Voldemort, returned to attack the school and subdue or destroy its defenders. 
        Numerous students, staff, parents, graduates, and friends of Hogwarts rose to the school's defense in its hour of need, 
        including the notorious poltergeist Peeves. Thanks to Harry Potter, Lord Voldemort was permanently destroyed 
        and his Death Eaters disbanded forever. Minerva McGonagall became the Headmistress of the school. 
        Hogwarts sustained extensive damage during the battle. Multiple areas of the main building and adjacent areas 
        were set on fire or blown up, and the Quidditch pitch was largely destroyed by fire. After the battle, 
        Hogwarts was repaired. Some students, such as Hermione Granger, returned to the school to complete their education. </p>

      <p class= "passage">Normal school life had resumed with McGonagall still as Headmistress and Hagrid still as Keeper of the Keys. 
        Many descendants of previous students were now coming to Hogwarts as new pupils, 
        and Neville Longbottom became the Professor for Herbology after retiring as an Auror.</p>
